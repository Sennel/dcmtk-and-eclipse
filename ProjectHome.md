This project contains a tutorial about how to use the DCMTK in Eclipse. This guide is written for using the Dicom toolkit (by DICOM@OFFIS) on the IDE Eclipse
(on Fedora Core 9) and describes how to compile an example program. This document
was written for the UMCG department Radiology . For this guide we used the Read me
and Install file included in the DCMTK package. We also got help from the people at the
DICOM@OFFIS forums, thanks a lot guys!

If there is anything wrong in this tutorial, pleas contact the DICOM@OFFIS forum.
